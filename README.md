# sudoku-solver
This piece of code will solve any Sudoku puzzle that is solvable, usually within less than 10 seconds.

* The "games" variable has some precoded games inside and you will be prompted to to chose one when you run the code.<br />
* Once a game is chosen, the correct solution will print onto the terminal.<br />
* The code will also let you know if the game is not solvable.

The third precoded game is interesting to observe and see how it would play out.

Here is an example of how an actual Sudoku game might look like when written in a Python array:
